## Getting Started

- Type ```git clone https://github.com/LallieDragon/trivia-with-react.git``` into 
your CLI to install the game. 
- ```cd react-trivia```
- ```npm install``` to install dependencies.
- ```npm start``` to run in localhost:3000.

## The Concept

This is the final project for the Web Development Immersive course
put on by General Assembly - Austin. The goal was to create a web
application in a week using any programming language that we had 
learned, inside or outside of the course.

I decided to create a Trivia application using React.js and 
render data from children through lift functions instead of Redux.
